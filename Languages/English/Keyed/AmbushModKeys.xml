		When set to something > 0, For each 10 in game days, current site maps will suffer this number of raids. This value is only math expectation but not exact value.
		\nOnly human hostile factions and mechs may attack your site maps. However with Anomaly DLC active, some entities may also be spawn based on current monolith level.
		\nThe calculation works in similar way of previous settings for world map ambushes.
		\nPlease note that this option works only for site maps, such as mining sites discovered by remote scanner, quest maps or hostile faction attack, etc.. Some mods may also generate site maps. But player settlement won't be touched.
